<p />POPFile is an automatic mail classification tool. Once properly set up and trained, it will work in the background of your computer, scanning mail as it arrives and filing it however you wish.

<p />For more information and post-install instructions, see the website at <a href="http://popfile.sourceforge.net/">http://popfile.sourceforge.net/</a> You may want to open this url in a browser and bookmark it before continuing with the installation.

<p />This installation package will suggest a reboot after it completes. The installation will check for symlinks in the installation paths and generate an error if it finds any. If a problem is detected the installation will terminate.
