Maybe the  "asm { mov r10, r4; }"  is required before the return
to balance the register usage?

I can only get the code to compile with thumb mode on (default) and
optimizations off.  When it does compile, it seems to work just fine
(e.g. a 40k armlet functions correctly while using lots of read/write
global variables and callbacks...)

( Heh!  :-)  I just kept renaming the variable until it matched the
register that the disassembly said the compiler was actually using
(for my sanity).   But I would like to find some clean syntax that
will safely survive compiler optimizations (the code I posted
obviously won't!).

I'm almost ready to try using gcc-arm-elf to build my armlet
entry point and concatenate that in front of the CW v9 output.
Messy...
