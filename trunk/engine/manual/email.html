<h2>Getting Your Email Program To Talk To POPFile</h2>

<p>POPFile works as a <i>proxy server</i>. Your email program talks to POPFile, which talks to your email server on its behalf. Instead of your email program getting messages directly, POPFile grabs them first, and scans them to decide what bucket they should go into.</p>

<p>Once it's decided - which takes only a fraction of a second - POPFile does one of two things: it can add a tag like [this] to the start of the subject line; which means that simple filtering programs like Microsoft Outlook Express can deliver your mail where it's supposed to - or, for more advanced email programs like Eudora, it can add a new email header like this:</p>

<p><code>X-Text-Classification: personal</code></p>

<p>- which your email program can use as a filter.</p>

<p>However, you need to do two things to get your email program talking to POPFile:

<ol><li>Adjust your email program's settings to make it talk to POPFile, and
<li>set up your email filters so that things get filed properly.</ol></p>

<p>Let's adjust the mail settings first. We'll set up filters in a moment.

<p>Below are instructions for some of the more popular email programs. For others - or for advanced users - here are the general instructions:</p>

<p><ul><li>Change the POP3 server name in your email client to 127.0.0.1, noting the original address.
<li>Change the POP3 user name to [original-POP3-server-address]:[username]
<li>Leave the password alone</ul></p>

<p>For accounts using Secure Password Authentication, see 'Using POPFile with: Secure Passwords', available from the tabs above.</p>

<table width=100% bgcolor=#FFFFFF cellspacing=3 border=0><tr>

<td colspan=3 align="center">

Just choose your email program and follow the column down. While these instructions might look complicated, they actually only take about two minutes - and it's hard to go wrong. (Just in case, make a note of your original settings in case you need to go back.)

<h3 align=center>Outlook</h3>

<ul>
<li>In Outlook select the Tools->Email Accounts... menu option.  The E-mail Accounts dialog will appear.
<li>Click View or change existing e-mail accounts and click Next.  Choose the account you want to use POPFile with and click Change...
Make a note of the Incoming mail server (POP3) server name and the User Name.
<li>Change the Incoming mail server (POP3) server name to <b>127.0.0.1</b> and change the User Name to the combination of the original
Incoming mail server (POP3) server name and the original User Name separated by a colon.
<li>So, if the original Incoming mail server (POP3) name was <b>my.mail.com</b> and your username was <b>jdoe</b>, your new username would be <b>my.mail.com:jdoe</b>
<li>You don't need to change the password.
<li>Hit Next and then Finish.
<li>Ensure that POPFile is running and all mail will be delivered through POPFile!
<li>You'll need to make sure POPFile starts whenever Windows does. If you're using the Windows installer version, you can drag the 'Start POPFile in Background' link from the POPFile group in the Start menu to the <code>Startup</code> group. Now, Windows will load POPFile each time.
<li>Important! If POPFile isn't loaded, the mail will not get through - and your email program won't connect!
</ul>

<h3 align=center>Outlook Express</h3>

<ul>
<li>In Outlook Express select the Tools->Accounts... menu option.  The Internet Accounts dialog will appear.
<li>Select the account you wish to modify to use POPFile and click on Properties.
<li>Choose the Servers tab.  Make a note of the Incoming Mail (POP3) server name and the Incoming Mail Server Account Name.
<li>Change the Incoming Mail (POP3) server name to <b>127.0.0.1</b> and change the Incoming Mail Server Account Name to the combination of the original Incoming Mail (POP3) server name and the original Incoming Mail Server Account Name separated by a colon.
<li>So, if the original Incoming Mail server name was <b>my.mail.com</b> and your username was <b>jdoe</b>, your new username would be <b>my.mail.com:jdoe</b>

<p>Okay. Now we've done that, it's time to set up your mail filters, so that once POPFile has done its work, your email program can take that and put everything in the right folder.</p>

<p>For advanced users, you have the option to modify the subject line to add a [classification] tag or not. It's near the bottom of the Configure tab in the web UI. No matter which option you choose, the <code>X-Text-Classification</code> header is still added.</p>

<h2>That's all there it to it!... but...</h2>

Despite all this, POPFile still won't filter mail right now. Why not? <i>It doesn't know what any of the buckets you entered mean.</i> It has no idea what 'spam' and 'genuine' mean, or what 'work' and 'personal' are.  It doesn't even know what language your e-mail is in - and it doesn't care. You need to train it to distinguish spam from regular email, or one project from another. You do this through <b>training</b> - and <a href="training.html">we'll deal with that next</a>.
