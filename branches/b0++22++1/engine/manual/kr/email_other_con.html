<ul>

<li>In Eudora select the Tools->Options... menu option.  The Options dialog will appear. <a href=../e_popfile1.gif>[screenshot]</a>
<li>Make a note of the Mail Server (incoming) server name and the Login Name. <a href=../e_popfile2.gif>[screenshot]</a>
<li>Change the Mail Server (incoming) server name to <b>127.0.0.1</b> and change the Login Name to the combination of the original
Mail Server (incoming) server name and the original Login Name separated by a colon.  <a href=../e_popfile3.gif>[screenshot]</a>
<li>So, if the original Mail Server (incoming) server name was <b>my.mail.com</b> and your username was <b>jdoe</b>, your new username would be <b>my.mail.com:jdoe</b>
<li>You don't need to change the password.
<li>Hit OK.
<li>Ensure that POPFile is running and all mail will be delivered through POPFile.
<li>You'll need to make sure POPFile starts whenever Windows does. If you're using the Windows installer version, you can drag the 'Start POPFile in Background' link from the POPFile group in the Start menu to the <b>Startup</b> group. Now, Windows will load POPFile each time.
<li>Important! If POPFile isn't loaded, the mail will not get through - and your email program won't connect!
